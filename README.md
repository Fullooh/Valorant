# Valorant Predictive Model Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application designed to predict player performance metrics, match outcomes, and economy status in Valorant games. It utilizes a **Python** backend (Flask) for data processing and machine learning, and a **React** frontend for user interaction and data visualization.

## Features
